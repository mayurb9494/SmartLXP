This repository contains a prototype for a Learning Experience Platform (LXP) built to demonstrate the concept of personalized learning and interactive course management.
Static Data Demo: Currently uses static data to showcase the platform's UI, structure, and functionality.
Course Management Concept: View courses, lessons, and learning paths in a conceptual layout.
Interactive UI Elements: Explore the design and flow of an LXP with quizzes, course cards, and dashboards (all static).
Cross-Platform Concept: Designed with mobile platforms in mind, using Swift, Java, and React Native technologies.
This project is intended as a conceptual demonstration of an LXP. Dynamic backend integration and real-time data features can be added in future development.
